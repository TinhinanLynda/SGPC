# Surface Imperfections - Three.js Daily

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/miroleon/pen/gOBYRpY](https://codepen.io/miroleon/pen/gOBYRpY).

This CodePen is part of a series of daily projects I did - primarily for Instagram. The 3D model is based on the anime "Ghost in the Shell" and was originally made by the user @naxete on Sketchfab, which I slightly modified in Cinema 4D and loaded into the three.js project as an FBX file. The project mostly serves as a test for rendering surface imperfections in three.js. You can find the original post with music on Instagram:
